<h1>Make Your Decisions</h1>
<p>
    Enter the quality of your product. Quality ranges from 0 to 100 with 100 being the highest quality obtainable. Customers prefer higher quality to lower quality products. As you increase the quality of your product, the cost to make your product increases. If you set your quality level to 1, it will cost your firm $1 to produce that product. Alternatively if you set the quality of your product to 100, it will cost $100 to product that product. In our game, a quality of 60 or higher is considered a high quality product.

    <p>Enter your investment into informal signals. Your level must be above 0, and can be as high as you choose. Investing is not free and your costs increase as you invest more in informal signals. The cost per product is equal to half of your investment in informal signals</p>

     A formal certification informs consumers that your quality is high and has been verified. To access formal certifications, your product must meet a minimum quality of 60. Once you enter in a quality above 60 you can access formal certifications. Just as in real life, you cannot call your product USDA organic if it does not meet the requirements of being USDA organic. Examples of formal certificats would be USDA Organic, Fair Trade, Non-GMO, or any form of certification that requires a licensed third party organization to verify your quality. You incur a cost for certification, the cost per product is $10.
